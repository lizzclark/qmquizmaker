## QM Quizmaker

A package that creates an interactive command-line quiz from a .txt file of questions and answers

- You install globally, then run the command “qmquiz” in terminal
- You are prompted to select a .txt file from the working directory that contains your questions and answers (a template for this is included in the package)
- QMQ creates a .js file which contains your quiz!

### Template and Examples

- 'template.txt' contains an example quiz and an explanation of the formatting rules for the .txt files that QMQ will work on
- The 'examples' folder contains some sample .txt files and the .js files that QMQ created from them.
- Play my exciting German Facts quiz to give you a taster of what QMQ can do!

### Future features

- More prompt types: the template contains more than 1 possible type of question (multiple choice vs text entry)
- Quiz aliases: you’re prompted to give your quiz a name, and then you can run “qmquiz play capitalcities” (or some other command like that) and it plays your capital cities quiz
