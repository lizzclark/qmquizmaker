Make your quiz look a little something like this!

Formatting rules:

- You can optionally include a comment at the top of your file, above your quiz (just like this paragraph)
- Your quiz must start with a title wrapped in double-hashes (##) and followed by a double line-break
- Question blocks are separated from each other by a double line-break
- You can number your questions however you want, or not at all if you prefer. They will appear in the quiz in the same order as in your .txt file
- Possible answers are on a new line and are given a key, like so:
a. 
b. 
c. 
OR
A)
B)
C)
- The final line of the block is "Ans:" and then the correct answer's key. (Essentially, the last character in this line must match the first character in the correct answer's line)
