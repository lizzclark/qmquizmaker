Make your quiz look a little something like this!

Formatting rules:

- You can optionally include a comment at the top of your file, above your quiz (just like this paragraph)
- Your quiz must start with a title wrapped in double-hashes (##) and followed by a double line-break
- Question blocks are separated from each other by a double line-break
- You can optionally number your questions - this is best done with a bracket like "1)" or "(1)". Whether numbered or not, they will appear in the quiz in the same order as in your .txt file
- There can be any number of possible answers. Each one is on a new line and has a key, like so:
a. 
b. 
c. 
d.
  
OR
 
A)
B)
C)
- The final line of a question block is "Ans:" and then the correct answer's key. (Essentially, the last character in this line must match the first character in the correct answer's line)
- NO DOTS - nowhere in a question block can you include a "."
- The last question of the quiz is followed by a double line-break and then "## END ##"
